    A Futura Pendulum is a simple Control Theroy learning tool. It is comprised of a rotating arm and a pendulum attached to the end. This project is a 
    review of a developed full state feed back control model created in Simulink [1]. The model neglects friction, when considering the mass relative to the fricton of       the bearings in the pendulum it is a good assumtion that the coefficient of friction is too small to significantly impact the model.

    The system is modeled as a 2 DOF system. One rotation about the axis of the motor and one rotation about the axis of the arm which the pendulum rotates around. A
    system was developed which was non-linear. Using state-space representation the final matricies were found to be:
    [Super hot matrices go here]
    Using computational solvers the poles of the system can be found to be: 
    [POLES]
    As shown in the graph below, the system is a stable system as modeled in this simulation. Adding in real variables such as friction may move the poles closer 
    to the right and thus closer to instability.

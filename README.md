    A Futura Pendulum is a simple Control Theroy learning tool. It is comprised of a rotating arm and a pendulum attached to the end. This project is a 
    review of a developed full state feed back control model created in Simulink [1]. The model neglects friction, when considering the mass relative to the fricton of       the bearings in the pendulum it is a good assumtion that the coefficient of friction is too small to significantly impact the model.
